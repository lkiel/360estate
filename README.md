# THE 360ESTATE
The 360 Estate is a virtual reality Android app allowing users to visit real-estate properties through 360 panoramas. You can move between panoramas by touching visual cues displayed on the screen. To explore a given panorama, either swipe your finger across the screen or physically tilt your device. The app uses the gyroscope of your phone to adjust the view appropriately.

It is complemented by a web front-end allowing real-estate brokers to consult requests made by their clients from within the app.
